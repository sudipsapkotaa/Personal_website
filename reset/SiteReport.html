    In this report, I will share my experience of learning the basics of web
    development and the process of designing, coding, and debugging a website.
    Throughout the module, I had ups and downs and faced many challenges, but
    the experience has been valuable in developing my skills.
  </p>

  <div class="section-heading">Technical and Design Development</div>
  <p>
    Over the course of the module, I developed a website using HTML and CSS.
    The website focuses on showcasing my skills and experience, with a clean
    and minimalistic design that is easy to navigate. To achieve this, I chose
    a color scheme that is simple and easy on the eyes, with a font that is
    clear and easy to read.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the early stages of development, I found it challenging to understand
    the technicalities of web development, but I gradually became more
    comfortable with coding and debugging. Through online tutorials and
    classes, I learned how to structure and style web pages, as well as how
    to incorporate responsive design.
  </p>

  <div class="section-heading">Reflective Discussion of My Experience</div>
  <p>
    Overall, I found the module to be challenging, but also extremely rewarding.
    I gained a better understanding of web development and the process of coding,
    designing, and debugging. I learned how to structure web pages using HTML and
    style them using CSS. I also gained an understanding of the importance of
    designing for a positive user experience.
  </p>

  <div class="section-heading">Validation Reports</div>
  <div class="validation">
    <p>
      Throughout the development of my website, I frequently checked the validation
      reports to ensure that my pages were HTML and CSS validated. Here are the
      screenshots of my validation reports:

      In conclusion, this module has been a valuable experience for me, as I have
      gained a better understanding of web development, coding, and design. Through
      the development of my website, I learned how to structure and style web pages,
      design for a positive user experience, and debug errors. I am excited to continue
